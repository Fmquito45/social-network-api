# social-network-api

## Description

I built this API for a social network web application so that users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. In order to build this API I had to apply new skill sets that I've learned throughout the module. This is what motivated me in creating this API, to see it come to life and be beneficial for all users so that they can navigate through all the interaction the social network application provides. For this API to function properly I had to familiarize in how to use MongoDB. MongoDB can handle large amount of data and has great flexibility with unstructured data. This allowed me to create the API that uses a NOSQL database. I also used express.js for routing and a new package called, Mongoose. I learned how to created models for the user which needed a username and email. Also models for thoughts and reactions. I also created API routes for the user, thoughts, friends and reaction. These routes consisted of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Through these routes you are able to get all/single user and all/single thought. You are also able to create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database. As well as reaction to thouhgts and friends. I learned how to start the server with a in-line command to sync the Mongoose models with the MongoDB database. All data for each route was set to properly be displayed in fromatted JSON. With these skills applied I was able to get this social network to operate as it should. It was a great experience building this API so that user can get around sharing their thoughts, reacting to friends thoughts and adding friends to their list.
